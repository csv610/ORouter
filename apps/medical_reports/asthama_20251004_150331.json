  "condition_name": "Asthma",
  "summary": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. It affects people of all ages but often starts in childhood. Asthma can be managed with proper treatment, but it requires ongoing care to prevent severe attacks.",
  "category": "Respiratory",
  "icd_codes": [
    "J45.909"
  ],
  "pathophysiology": "Asthma is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways, leading to bronchial hyperresponsiveness. This inflammation results in swelling of the airway walls, increased mucus production, and bronchoconstriction. The combination of these factors narrows the airways, making it difficult to breathe. Triggers such as allergens, exercise, or infections can exacerbate these symptoms.",
  "etiology": [
    "Genetic predisposition",
    "Environmental allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, pet dander)",
    "Air pollution",
    "Respiratory infections",
    "Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke",
    "Occupational exposures (e.g., chemicals, dust)"
  ],
  "types": [
    "Allergic asthma: Triggered by allergens",
    "Non-allergic asthma: Triggered by non-allergic factors such as exercise, cold air, or stress",
    "Occupational asthma: Caused by workplace exposures",
    "Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: Triggered by aspirin and other NSAIDs"
  ],
  "stages": [
    "Intermittent asthma: Symptoms occur less than twice a week and nighttime symptoms less than twice a month",
    "Mild persistent asthma: Symptoms occur more than twice a week but less than once a day",
    "Moderate persistent asthma: Symptoms occur daily and nighttime symptoms more than once a week",
    "Severe persistent asthma: Symptoms occur throughout the day and nighttime symptoms frequently"
  ],
  "epidemiology": {
    "prevalence": "Affects approximately 25 million people in the United States",

      "Obesity",

    "signs": [
      "Wheezing on auscultation",
      "Prolonged expiratory phase",
      "Use of accessory muscles for breathing",
      "Decreased peak expiratory flow rate",
      "Tachypnea (increased respiratory rate)"
    ],
    "onset": "Symptoms can start suddenly or gradually, often triggered by specific factors. Common age of onset is childhood, but it can develop at any age.",
    "severity_spectrum": "Mild: Symptoms occur infrequently and are easily managed. Moderate: Symptoms occur more frequently and require regular medication. Severe: Symptoms are persistent and require multiple medications for control."
