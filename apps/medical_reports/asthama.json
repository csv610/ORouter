  "condition_name": "Asthma",
  "summary": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. It is a common condition that affects people of all ages and can be managed with proper treatment.",
  "category": "Respiratory",
  "icd_codes": [
    "J45.909",
    "J45.998",
    "J45.999"
  ],
  "pathophysiology": "Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, which leads to airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, and airway remodeling. This results in narrowing of the airways, making it difficult to breathe. The inflammation is typically driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.",
  "etiology": [
    "Genetic predisposition",
    "Environmental factors (e.g., allergens, pollutants)",
    "Respiratory infections",
    "Occupational exposures",
    "Smoking"

  "stages": [
    "Intermittent",
    "Mild persistent",
    "Moderate persistent",
    "Severe persistent"
  ],
  "epidemiology": {
    "prevalence": "Asthma affects approximately 300 million people worldwide.",
    "incidence": "The incidence of asthma is higher in children and young adults.",
    "risk_factors": [
      "Family history of asthma or allergies",
      "Exposure to allergens (e.g., dust mites, pollen, pet dander)",
      "Exposure to tobacco smoke",
      "Air pollution",
      "Obesity"
    ],
    "demographics": "Asthma is more common in children and young adults, and it affects both males and females."

    "onset": "Symptoms can be intermittent or persistent, often triggered by allergens, exercise, or respiratory infections.",
    "severity_spectrum": "Symptoms can range from mild to severe, with severe cases leading to asthma attacks that require immediate medical attention."
